# Agent Based Vulnerability Scanning

<img src="images/hero.png" alt="" width=600/><br />

## Purpose

I will use Microsoft Azure to create virtual machines and perform an agent-based scan on a Windows and Linux device. This lab demonstrates a real-world scenario where scanning can be done remotely on a scheduled basis or triggered by a file being present. In this case, I will do a trigger-based scan where a scan will initiate when the specified file is detected in the Nessus Trigger file path.
